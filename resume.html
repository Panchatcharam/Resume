                    <p id ="description">The Gateway is responsible for wireless interface with HART sensors such as temperature, pressure which are part of mesh network.  These sensors join the Gateway using Network ID and Join Key for which the sensors are already configured before deployment. At a certain interval rate these HART nodes wakes up and push measurement data up to Gateway.  The Gateway provides interface to clients such as Web, ModBus, EtherNet/IP, HART-IP and OPC. These clients read the measurement data of sensors and displays to the end user.</p>
